Welcome to my digital domain — where code compiles, pixels align, and creativity meets caffeine.
I’m a Java Spring Boot developer, currently leveling up in React and exploring the world of microservices.
I’ve also got a Pythonic side, and I’m diving into PHP and Laravel one blade file at a time.
A builder of things, breaker of bugs, and eternal student of the stack.
Feel free to explore my projects, inspect my code, or summon me for a collaboration.
May your scrolls be smooth and your 404s be few.

## 🌟 Reflection: STAR Technique

🎭 Situation

After failing Java in my second year, I had to practice day in and day out—but even with all that effort, I still failed the first test of the year.

📋 Task

I knew I had to pass my second year, or I’d have to leave Cape Town and give up everything I was working toward.

🎯 Action

I committed to studying every day and learned to ask for help when I didn’t understand something. Thankfully, my aunt is a data scientist and my uncle is a software engineer, so I reached out to them for guidance whenever I got stuck.
More importantly, even when things weren’t going my way, I dug deep and faced the challenge head-on. I told myself that this is what I want to do for a living, and I wasn’t going to let anything stop me from earning this qualification and becoming a better programmer.

🏆 Result

The hard work paid off — I passed the year quite well and even came close to getting a distinction.
I discovered strengths I didn’t realize I had, and I gained a clearer sense of the areas I still need to improve.
Most importantly, it confirmed my passion for backend development, microservices, Java, and Spring Boot — and now I’m focused on improving my frontend skills by the end of this year to become a more complete developer
